30 days challenge containing various topics. 

## NodeJs 

1. **Event Loop**  

2. **Parallel execution**   
Nodejs is a single threaded application. However there are ways we can make use of the multiple threads / CPU cores to effectively utilize the available resources. 

   a. [Child Processes](https://github.com/kk2491/30-days-revision-challenge/blob/main/nodejs-parallel-execution/child-processes/REAMDE.md) 
   
   b. [Clusters](https://github.com/kk2491/30-days-revision-challenge/blob/main/nodejs-parallel-execution/clusters/README.md)

   For now, only the child processe and Clusters are covered, other methods will be captured in the later part. 

3. **Closures**     
   * The inner function retains the access to the paramters of the outer function, even though the outer function execution is completed.  
   * During normal function the variables / parameters are removed as soon as the function returns. However in case of closure, along with the function the parameters from the outer function is stored in the heap. Hence accessible for longer period of time.   

   Interview question  

   ```
   for (let/var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    const log = function () {
      console.log("i : ", i);
      return;
    };

    setTimeout(log, 1000);
   }
   ```
   
   In the above example, when `var` is used, the variable gets hoisted to the global scope. Hence the value of the `i` becomes 3.   
   However when `let` is used, in each loop `i` the value of `i` is retained. 

4. **Design Patterns** - TODO  

5. **OOP** - TODO     
   a. Abstraction
   b. Encapsulation
   c. Inheritance
   d. Polymorphism 

## MongoDB 

1. **Aggregation**   

2. **Join** - WIP  
   * createView in MongoDB    
       Mongodb provides `createView` to perform joining of 2 collections, you can find the reference [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/views/join-collections-with-view/#:~:text=You%20can%20use%20%24lookup%20to,construct%20or%20maintain%20complex%20pipelines.)

   * Equivalent operation in Mongoose - TODO
